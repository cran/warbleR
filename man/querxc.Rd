\title{Access Xeno-Canto recordings and metadata}
\usage{
querxc(qword, download = FALSE, X = NULL, parallel = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{qword}{Character vector of length one indicating the genus, or genus and
species, to query Xeno-Canto database. For example, \emph{Phaethornis} or \emph{Phaethornis longirostris}. 
(\url{http://www.xeno-canto.org/}).}

\item{download}{Logical argument. Downloads recording file names and
associated metadata if \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, recordings are also downloaded to working
directory as .mp3 files. Default is \code{FALSE}. Note that if the recording is already in the 
working directory (as when the downloading process has been interrupted) it will be skipped. 
Hence, resuming downloading processes will not start from scratch.}

\item{X}{Data frame with the same columns as the output of the function, or at least the following
columns: Genus, Specific_epithet and Recording_ID. Only the recordings listed in the data frame 
will be download (\code{download} argument is automatically set to \code{TRUE}). This can be used to select
the recordings to be downloaded based on their attributes.}

\item{parallel}{Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing).
Not available in Windows OS.}
}
\value{
If X is not provided the function returns a data frame with the following recording information: recording ID, Genus, Specific epithet, Subspecies, English name, Recordist, Country, Locality, Latitude, Longitude, Vocalization type, Audio file, License, URL, Quality,Time, Date. Sound files in .mp3 format are downloaded into the working directory if download = \code{TRUE} or if X is provided.
}
\description{
\code{querxc} downloads recordings and metadata from Xeno-Canto (\url{http://www.xeno-canto.org/}).
}
\details{
This function queries for avian vocalization recordings in the open-access
online repository Xeno-Canto (\url{http://www.xeno-canto.org/}). It can return recordings metadata
or can also download the associated sound files.
