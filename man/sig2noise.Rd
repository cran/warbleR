}
\usage{
sig2noise(X, mar)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Data frame with results from \code{\link{manualoc}} or any data frame with columns
for sound file name (sound.files), selection number (selec), and start and end time of signal
(start and end).}

\item{mar}{numeric vector of length 1. Specifies the margins adjacent to
the start and end points of selection over which to measure noise.}
}
\value{
Data frame similar to \code{\link{autodetec}} output, but also includes a new variable
with the signal-to-noise values.
}
\description{
\code{sig2noise} measures signal-to-noise ratio across multiple files.
}
\details{
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a measure of the level of a desired signal compared to
 background noise. The function divides the mean amplitude of the signal by
  the mean amplitude of the background noise adjacent to the signal.
  A general margin to apply before and after the acoustic signal must
  be specified. Setting margins for individual signals that have been
  previously clipped from larger files may take some optimization, as
  for calls within a larger file that are irregularly separated. When
  margins overlap with another acoustic signal nearby, the signal-to-noise
  ratio (SNR) will be inaccurate. Any SNR less than or equal to one suggests
  background noise is equal to or overpowering the acoustic signal.
  \code{\link{snrspecs}} can be used to troubleshoot different noise margins.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# First create empty folder
dir.create(file.path(getwd(),"temp"))
setwd(file.path(getwd(),"temp"))

data(list = c("Arre.aura","manualoc.df"))
writeWave(Arre.aura, "Arre.aura.wav") #save sound files

# specifying the correct margin is important
# use snrspecs to troubleshoot margins for sound files
sig2noise(manualoc.df[grep("Arre", manualoc.df$sound.files), ], mar = 0.2)

# this smaller margin doesn't overlap neighboring signals
sig2noise(manualoc.df[grep("Arre", manualoc.df$sound.files), ], mar = 0.1)

# remove example directory
unlink(getwd(),recursive = TRUE)
