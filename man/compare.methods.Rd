\arguments{
\item{X}{'selection_table' object or data frame with results from \code{\link{manualoc}} function, \code{\link{autodetec}} 
function, or any data frame with columns for sound file name (sound.files), 
selection number (selec), and start and end time of signal (start and end).
Default \code{NULL}.}

\item{flim}{A numeric vector of length 2 for the frequency limit in kHz of 
the spectrogram, as in \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}. Default is c(0, 22).}

\item{bp}{numeric vector of length 2 giving the lower and upper limits of the 
frequency bandpass filter (in kHz) used in the acoustic distance methods. Default is c(0, 22).}

\item{mar}{Numeric vector of length 1. Specifies plot margins around selection in seconds. Default is 0.1.}

\item{wl}{A numeric vector of length 1 specifying the window length of the spectrogram and cross-correlation, default 
is 512.}

\item{ovlp}{Numeric vector of length 1 specifying the percent overlap between two 
consecutive windows, as in \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}. Default is 90.}

\item{res}{Numeric argument of length 1. Controls image resolution.
Default is 150.}

\item{n}{Numeric argument of length 1. Defines the number of plots to be produce. 
Default is 10.}

\item{length.out}{A character vector of length 1 giving the number of measurements of fundamental or dominant
frequency desired (the length of the time series). Default is 30.}

\item{methods}{A character vector of length 2 giving the names of the acoustic distance
methods that would be compared. The methods available are: 
\itemize{
   \item \code{XCORR}: cross-correlation (\code{\link{xcorr}} function)
   \item \code{dfDTW}: dynamic time warping on dominant frequency contours (\code{\link{dfDTW}} function)
   \item \code{ffDTW}: dynamic time warping on fundamental frequency contours (\code{\link{ffDTW}} function)
   \item \code{SP}: spectral parameters (\code{\link{specan}} function)
   \item \code{SPharm}: spectral parameters (\code{\link{specan}} function with argument \code{harmonicity  = TRUE})
   \item \code{MFCC}: statistical descriptors of Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (\code{\link{mfcc_stats}} function)
   }}

\item{it}{A character vector of length 1 giving the image type to be used. Currently only
"tiff" and "jpeg" are admitted. Default is "jpeg".}

\item{parallel}{Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing).}

\item{path}{Character string containing the directory path where the sound files are located. 
If \code{NULL} (default) then the current working directory is used.}

\item{sp}{Data frame with acoustic parameters as the one generated by \code{\link{specan}}. Must contain 'sound.files'
and "selec' columns and the same selections as in 'X'.}

\item{pb}{Logical argument to control progress bar. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{grid}{Logical argument to control the presence of a grid on the spectrograms (default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{clip.edges}{Logical argument to control whether edges (start or end of signal) in
which amplitude values above the threshold were not detected will be removed when using dfDTW and 
ffDTW methods. If \code{TRUE} this edges will be excluded and signal contour will be calculated on the
remainging values. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{threshold}{amplitude threshold (\%) for dominant and/or fundamental frequency detection when using dfDTW, ffDTW 
and SP methods. Default is 15.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} all NAs produced when pairwise cross-correlations failed are removed from the 
results. This means that all selections with at least 1 cross-correlation that failed are excluded in both methods under
comparison. Only apply if XCORR is one of the methods being compared.}

\item{scale}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} dominant and/or fundamental frequency values are z-transformed using the \code{\link[base]{scale}} function, which "ignores" differences in absolute frequencies between the signals in order to focus the 
comparison in the frequency contour, regardless of the pitch of signals. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{pal}{A color palette function to be used to assign colors in the 
spectrograms, as in \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}. Default is reverse.gray.colors.2.}

\item{img}{A logical argument specifying whether an image files would be produced. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to a modified version of \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}} for customizing
graphical output. This includes fast.spec, an argument that speeds up the plotting of spectrograms (see description in 
\code{\link{specreator}}).}
}
\value{
Image files with 4 spectrograms of the selection being compared and scatterplots 
of the acoustic space of all signals in the input data frame 'X'.
}
\description{
\code{compare.methods} creates graphs to visually assess performance of acoustic distance measurements
}
\details{
This function produces graphs with spectrograms from 4 signals in the 
provided data frame that allow visual inspection of the performance of acoustic
distance methods at comparing those signals. The signals are randomly picked up
from the provided data frame (X argument).The spectrograms are all plotted with
the same frequency and time scales. The function compares 2 methods at a time. The
methods available are: cross-correlation 
(XCORR, from \code{\link{xcorr}}), dynamic time warping on dominant frequency time 
series (dfDTW, from \code{\link[dtw]{dtw}} applied on \code{\link{dfts}} output), dynamic time 
warping on dominant frequency time series (ffDTW, from \code{\link[dtw]{dtw}} applied on 
\code{\link{ffts}} output), spectral parameters (SP, from \code{\link{specan}}). The graph also 
contains 2 scatterplots (1 for each method) of the acoustic space of all signals in the 
input data frame 'X'. The compared selections are randomly picked up from the pool of 
selections in the input data frame. The argument 'n' defines the number of comparisons (i.e. graphs) 
to be produced. The acoustic pairwise distance between signals is shown next 
to the arrows linking them. The font color of a distance value correspond to the font 
color of the method that generated it, as shown in the scatterplots. Distances are 
standardized, being 0 the distance of a signal to itself and 1 the farthest pairwise 
distance in the pool of signals. Principal Component Analysis (\code{\link[stats]{prcomp}}) 
is applied to calculate distances when using spectral parameters (SP). In that case the first 2 PC's are used. Classical 
Multidimensional Scalling (also known as Principal Coordinates Analysis, 
(\code{\link[stats]{cmdscale}})) is used for all other methods. The graphs are return as image files in the 
working directory. The file name contains the methods being compared and the 
rownumber of the selections. This function uses internally a modified version
of the \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}} function from seewave package to create spectrograms.
