#' Simulated coordinated singing events.

#' @description \code{sim.coor.sing} Selections of simulated interactive singing events.The simulated events use the mean 
#' and standard deviation of real lekking \emph{Phaethornis longirostris} (Long-billed 
#' Hermit hummingbird) songs and intervals between songs (e.i gaps). Three events are simulated: overlapping signals (ovlp), 
#' alternating signals (altern) and non-synchronized signals (uncoor).
